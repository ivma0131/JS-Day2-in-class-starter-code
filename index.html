        <h3>Part 1 - <span class="head-text-dark">var vs let/const</span></h3>
          <p><b>Instructions: </b>Open the browser inspector and review the JS code for part 1.  
          Reviewing the output, explain how var scopes differently than let and why we'd use <b>let</b> over <b>var</b>.</p>
          <p>Explanation: The scope of var variables is a function-scope meaning that if declared inside a function it can only be accessed within 
          the function and not outside of it (globally). Additionally, it also means that anytime it is declared or redeclared anywhere inside
          a function, it ignores block-scope and overwrites any previous declaration. So if the var is declared inside the function then later 
          redeclared inside a block statement such as an if statement inside that function, then it overwrites the variable inside the function.
          Var declaration is useful when you want a variable to be available across an entire function, even in nested blocks.
          </p>
          <p>The scope of a let variable is a block-scope meaning that any let variables declared exist only inside the nearest set
          of {}. So if the let variable was declared in a function and then later declared inside a block in that function, then the value of the outer let
          isn't overwritten by the inner block variable it only stays in there. Let is useful when you want temporary variables that won't leak outside their block.</p>    
          <p>The scope of a const variable is the same block scope rules as let but once it is assigned it cannot be reassinged. Const is useful when you want to ensure a variable never changes reference.</p>

        <h3>Part 2 - <span class="head-text-dark">Template literals</span></h3>
        <p><b>Instructions: </b>Update the string in your JS code to use template literals instead of basic concatenation.<br>
        Also after this see if you can use a template literal to pull in your name via the myName variable and the proper yera using the today variable in your JS file.</p>

        <h3>Part 3 - <span class="head-text-dark">Ternary Operator</span></h3>
        <p><b>Instructions: </b>Update JS loop to use a ternary operator instead to get the same results of the original code in section 1.  You'll need to uncomment this to see what is expected .</p>
        <h4 id="result3">Replace this innerText with updated text</h4>

        <h3>Part 4 - <span class="head-text-dark">Arrow Functions</span></h3>
        <p><b>Instructions: </b>Update JS function in PART 4 of JS code to be an arrow function instead.  And then see if you can add a default value to the first function.  Output results in the console log</p>
    </section>

    <section id="5">
        <h3>Part 5 - <span class="head-text-dark">Array Methods</span></h3>
        <p><b>Instructions: </b>Update JS Part 5 code to use Array map() method to loop through results.  Also tag on a filter() method to only pull fruits that start with "b".  You can use LLM for this but make sure you provide context of 1) your current code, 2) your goal, and 3) clear expectations in terms of output detail.</p>
        <p>Context: we start with an array of fruits that uses a for-loop to add every fruit into the DOM</p>
        <p>Goal: the goal is to update the code to do the same function with modern array methods using
        filter and map</p>
        <p>Expectations: only fruits that start with letter b should appear when the button is clicked and
    clear text button should clear text</p>
        <h4 id="result5"></h4>
        <button onclick="printFruit()">Print Fruit array</button>
        <button onclick="clearText()">Clear text</button>

        <h3>Part 8 - <span class="head-text-dark">Try/Throw/Catch/Finally keywords for error handling</span></h3>
        <p><b>Instructions: </b>We've done some logical coding using if/else and ternary but what if there is an error. 
            How can we handle this?  This is what the <u>try/catch statement</u> is for.  You TRY various tests and THROW an error if that error test is true.  Then you can collect the errors in the CATCH block and use the FINALLY block to run code after the CATCH runs.  Update the InputValidation() function to use the try/catch/finally keywords to handle the following scenarios:
            <ol>
                <li>It should say 'Input is EMPTY" if nothing is in the textbox</li>
                <li>It should say 'Input is NOT A NUMBER' if not numeric</li>
                <li>It should say 'Input is TOO HIGH' if the number is higher than 15 or 'Input is TOO LOW' if below 10</li>
                <li>It should say 'Sucesss' if entry is a number between 10 and 15</li>
            </ol>
